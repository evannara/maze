  "readme": "Quintus Engine\n==============\n\nQuintus is an easy-to-learn, fun-to-use HTML5 game engine for mobile, desktop and beyond!\n\nThe Quintus engine is an HTML5 game engine designed to be modular and lightweight, with a concise JavaScript-friendly syntax. In lieu of trying to shoehorn a standard OOP-game engine structure into an HTML5 JavaScript engine, Quintus takes some cues from jQuery and provides plugins, events and a selector syntax. Instead of a deep single-inheritance-only model, Quintus provides a flexible component model in addition to traditional inheritance to make it easier to reuse functionality and share it across games and objects.\n\n**Warning: Quintus is at a very early stage of development, use at your own risk.***\n\n\n[![Quintus Platformer Example](https://raw.github.com/cykod/Quintus/master/examples/platformer.png)](http://html5quintus.com/quintus/examples/platformer/)\n\n[Example Annotated Source](http://html5quintus.com/quintus/docs/platformer.html)\n\nMore details and documentation at [HTML5Quintus.com](http://html5quintus.com/)\n\nRead the [Quintus Guide](http://html5quintus.com/guide/intro.md) to get started on the Engine.\n\nOnline Forum / Community\n========================\n\nFor general questions, demos, etc please post to the [Quintus HTML5 Game Engine G+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/104292074755089084725)\n\n\nUsing Quintus\n=============\n\nThe easiest way to use Quintus is simply to use the CDN hosted version at:\n\n    <!-- Production minified ~20k gzipped -->\n    <script src='http://cdn.html5quintus.com/v0.2.0/quintus-all.min.js'></script>\n\n    <!-- Full Source ~40k gzipped -->\n    <script src='http://cdn.html5quintus.com/v0.2.0/quintus-all.js'></script>\n\nQuintus has no dependencies.\n\nAlternatively you can clone the repo and either use each file separately or generate a unified version:\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/cykod/Quintus.git\n    $ cd Quintus\n    $ npm install\n    $ grunt\n    \nCheck the `dist/` directory for contatenated versions. \n\n\nHistory of Quintus\n==================\n\nThe initial version of Quintus was built over the course of writing [Professional HTML5 Mobile Game Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094P2TU6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0094P2TU6&linkCode=as2&tag=tun02-20), although the repo code has diverged a bit from the Engine built in the book, the main philosophy and technologies used have not changed, and reading the book will give you a fairly exhaustive understanding of the internals of the Quintus Engine.\n\nToDo\n====\n\nQuintus is a young engine that has a lot of missing gaps - some of which are pretty straightforward to fill in. If you are interested in hacking on Quintus, shoot me an email pascal at cykod period com, I'm happy to help folks get hacking on the engine.\n\nIf you have suggestions for additional enhancements, please add them to the Issues queue - no guarantee all ideas will be implemented and integrated into the core of the system, but suggestions welcome.\n\nHere's some specific pieces that need some love:\n\n* Update the Q.Scenes method to only render sprites that are visible in the grid. (so draw doesn't get called with thousands of sprites)\n* Fix the collision methods to calculate a collision magnitude based on dot product of sprite velocities\n* Turn into a Node binary for generating projects.\n* Add Spriter support into the engine\n* Add a simple level editor\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n### 0.2.0 Initial API Docs + Better Tiled Integration + Sloped Tiles\n* `quintus_tmx.js` TMX file extraction \n* Multi-layer TMX Support + Sloped Tiles by [lendrick](https://github.com/lendrick)\n* TMX Object layer support\n* TMX Repeater support\n* TMX Sensor tile support\n* SVG and Physics refactoring by [drFabio](https://github.com/drFabio)\n* Generate collision points performance optimization\n* Disasteroids Example\n* Initial Platformer Full Example\n* Initial API Documentation\n* Conditional Render and step support\n* Tower Man Example\n\n### 0.1.6 Assorted Fixes - 9/6/13\n* Fix by [A11oW](https://github.com/A11oW) to Quintus input\n* #41 - repeated rounding issues\n* Change SpriteSheet to use tileW, tileH instead of tilew, tileh\n* Add flipping to AIBounce componet by [fariazz](https://github.com/fariazz)\n* Add optional bounding box to viewport by [fariazz](https://github.com/fariazz)\n* Initial experiment with YuiDoc\n\n### 0.1.5 Assorted Fixes - 8/4/13\n* Assorted gruntfile stuff\n* Add hide, show, stop and start to stages\n* Per-sprite gravity override\n* Multi-layer support for TMX files by [fariazz](https://github.com/fariazz)\n* Fix to scene locate method #46 by [noahcampbell](https://github.com/noahcampbell)\n* Add support for sensors\n* Add support for loading scenes from a JSON file\n* auto-focus when keyboard controls are active\n* Add development mode: `Quintus({ development: true })` to make changing assets easier\n* Allow for easier opacity tweening\n* Simple TMX/XML parsing from [kvroman](https://github.com/kvroman)\n* Touch example fix from [scottheckel](http://github.com/scottheckel)\n\n### 0.1.4 Updated Node + Grunt -

1/1/13\n\n* Full SAT collision (rotation / scaling)\n* Container / Children support\n* Removed jQuery Dependency\n* Reworked collisions (need optimizations)\n* Add Quintus.UI module for containers, buttons and labels.\n* Added animate and tween support\n\n\n### 0.0.1 Unrelease \n\n* Initial Release\n* Basic Sprite and Scene Support\n* Limited Audio\n* jQuery Dependency\n* Keyframe animation support\n* 2D Platformer controls and animation\n* Limited SAT Collision (no rotation / scale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
